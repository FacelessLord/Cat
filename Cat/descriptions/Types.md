### Types

In catlang type(or class - interchangeable) is a way to define which properties object of that type have to have and how it's methods should change
this objects.

On compilation type transforms into an object that contains all static functions and methods
(made static by moving accessed object to argument list) with a default object that should be unchanged.
This value is used to enable run-time type checking and as a default value to initialize variable with/

In all compiled Type is an object whose properties are functions and constants
